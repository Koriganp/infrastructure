			<h2 class="about">George Smith</h2>
			<p>George is 28, single, and focused on his career as a marketing director. He has a long commute to his office downtown because he got a condo near the edge of town where the price of homes is cheaper. He likes to go out on the weekends and spends his free time working out, reading, watching movies, and surfing the web.</p>
			<p>Mr. Smith is very tech savvy and has been using the internet for most of his life. He likes to do all of his shopping online and uses streaming services for all his entertainment. He mostly uses his phone to access the web, but also uses his laptop, desktop, or iPad, depending on where he is at and what is handy.</p>
			<p>He noticed a pothole in the road on his way to work one day and wanted an easy and effective way to report his finding to actually get the repair done in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
